# Lending_Club_Case_Study
> I work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

We have performed EDA and univariate/bivariate Analysis to analyse the important attributes

## General Information
- Gneral Information - consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision. We have derived the critical attributes to identify this scenario
- What is the dataset that is being used? -  It contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

## Technologies Used
- pandas 
- numpy 
- matplotlib.
- seaborn

## Conclusions
- Lending club should give loans to borrowers who falls in higher income group more than 80 Lakhs as they have less chances of defaulting loans.
- Lending club should give loans to borrowers having (A ,B) grades as they have more chances of paying off their
loans instead of giving loans to lower grades likes (E,F and G) grades.
- Lending club should issue smaller amount for small business and debt consolidation purpose as increasing the loan amount increases the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) and hard for lenders to repay their loans.
- Borrowers are not able to repay their loans due to higher rates of interest , reducing the interest rate till 12% will reduces the EMI and they will be able to repay their loans on time.
- Borrowers who having home ownership as mortgage have chances of defaulting their loans due to they have
monthly mortgage payments.
